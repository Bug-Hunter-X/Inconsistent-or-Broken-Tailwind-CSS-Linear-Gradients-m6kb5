# Inconsistent or Broken Tailwind CSS Linear Gradients

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS linear gradients behave inconsistently across different components or after specific CSS changes. The gradient might appear as a solid color or broken, rather than the expected smooth transition.

## Bug Description

The issue involves the unpredictable rendering of `linear-gradient` in Tailwind CSS classes. In some cases, the gradient renders correctly, while in others, it might show as a single solid color or display a partially incorrect gradient pattern. This behavior can change depending on where the class is used, which other classes are applied, or other CSS alterations.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if any).
3. Open `brokenGradient.js` to observe the inconsistent gradient rendering.
4. Open `fixedGradient.js` to see how it's fixed.

## Solution

This was addressed in the `fixedGradient.js` file. In this scenario, the issue might stem from conflicts between different CSS styles, an incorrect order of classes, or unexpected interactions with the browser's rendering engine. The fix frequently involves carefully examining the CSS hierarchy and possibly re-ordering or adjusting styles.

## Troubleshooting Tips

* **Check for CSS Specificity:** Verify that your Tailwind CSS classes have sufficient specificity to override other potentially conflicting styles.
* **Inspect with Browser DevTools:**  Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the generated CSS and identify any unexpected styles or overrides that could be affecting the gradient.
* **Simplify Your CSS:** If possible, temporarily isolate the gradient component to rule out conflicts with surrounding elements.
* **Test with Different Browsers:**  Some inconsistencies might be browser-specific, so testing across different browsers can be helpful.
* **Ensure Proper Tailwind Configuration:** Check your Tailwind configuration to ensure all settings are correct and compatible.
