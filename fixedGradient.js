// Solution: Ensure there are no conflicting styles and classes are correctly structured.
// A simple fix might be to be more explicit with your gradient specifications and remove unnecessary conflicting classes.

// Example solution:
// In this example, the issue was likely due to a missing or mismatched class interfering with the gradient in the original implementation. In this improved code example, all classes and inline styles are carefully reviewed and only essential ones are included.
<div style="background-image: linear-gradient(to right, blue, purple);">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
